# CMU OAuth Integration

Use this skill when an agent needs to add, change, debug, or review a CMU Account login flow for any CMU-backed web project.

## What This Skill Covers

- `GET /api/auth/cmu` authorize redirect flow
- `GET /api/auth/cmu/callback` code exchange and user provisioning flow
- Microsoft Entra ID authorize and token endpoints
- CMU user profile lookup via `basicinfo`
- `oauth_state` cookie generation and validation
- Optional faculty, organization, or department gating
- JWT cookie issuance and post-login redirect logic
- Error code mapping back to the login page

## When to Use

Use this skill when the task mentions any of these terms or behaviors:

- CMU OAuth
- CMU Account login
- Microsoft Entra ID or Azure AD callback
- `oauth_state`
- `CMU_CLIENT_ID`, `CMU_CLIENT_SECRET`, `CMU_REDIRECT_URI`
- `not_nursing_faculty`, `oauth_token_failed`, or related login errors
- JWT cookie issuance after third-party login

## Primary References

Read these first when the task needs implementation detail:

- [OAuth reference](./references/oauth-reference.md)
- [Source routes and file map](./references/file-map.md)

## Procedure

1. Identify the requested slice.
   Match the task to one of these control points:
   - authorize route construction
   - callback validation
   - token exchange
   - CMU profile fetch
   - user upsert and access control
   - JWT cookies and redirect destination
   - login-page error handling

2. Confirm the local integration boundary before editing.
   Read the relevant target files in the repo rather than re-deriving the flow from scratch. Start from the owning authorize route, callback route, session helper, or login surface for the current project.

3. Preserve the required security model.
   Keep these invariants intact:
   - generate a random `state` value server-side
   - store `oauth_state` as an httpOnly cookie with short lifetime
   - reject callback requests when query `state` does not match the cookie
   - perform token exchange only on the server
   - do not persist the CMU access token after user info is fetched

4. Implement the external OAuth steps in order.
   The expected callback sequence is:
   - validate `state`
   - exchange `code` for an access token using the token endpoint
   - request CMU basic info with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
   - verify the required CMU organization or faculty rule when the product has one
   - link or upsert the local user according to project access rules
   - reject inactive users
   - issue app session cookies or JWTs
   - clear the temporary `oauth_state` cookie
   - redirect according to role and onboarding state

5. Keep project-specific redirect logic aligned with the rest of the app.
   Common examples:
   - privileged roles -> dashboard or operations home
   - users missing consent or onboarding -> required gate page
   - otherwise -> normal role home

6. Map failures to stable login error codes.
   Reuse the documented codes instead of inventing new ones unless the task explicitly requires a new UX path.

7. Validate narrowly after edits.
   Prefer the smallest check that can falsify the change:
   - targeted auth or route tests when available
   - focused lint or typecheck for touched files
   - manual review against the documented sequence only if no executable check exists

## Decision Rules

- If the task is about route wiring before redirect to Microsoft, work in the authorize route.
- If the task is about callback query params, token exchange, CMU API responses, or login failures after returning from Microsoft, work in the callback route.
- If the task is about auth cookie names, expiry, secure flags, or JWT creation, inspect the project's session helper before changing route logic.
- If the task is about what users see after failure, inspect the login page and its error-code mapping.
- If the task changes required environment variables, update both the implementation and `env.example` or docs that define deployment inputs.

## Quality Checks

The work is complete only when these are still true:

- the authorize route constructs the correct Microsoft authorize URL
- the callback refuses mismatched or missing `state`
- the server exchanges the code and fetches CMU user info without exposing the client secret
- disallowed CMU organizations or faculties are rejected with the documented error code when gating is enabled
- inactive users remain blocked
- successful logins issue the app auth cookies and clear `oauth_state`
- redirect targets still respect role and onboarding rules
- docs or environment examples stay in sync with any contract changes

## Output Expectations

When using this skill, the agent should finish with:

- the minimal code change for the requested OAuth behavior
- any necessary test or doc updates
- a short note describing which control point changed and how it was validated
